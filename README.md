## Customer / Use Case
The Brazilian government is interested in the impact of climate changes on the country's economy. To gain insight into this, they want to know what effect the weather has had on the country's export. Example: Does more rain directly correlate to more exported products?

## Datasets
We are using two datasets. One that describes Brazil exports from 2010-2020 and one that describes the weather in Brazil from 2000-2021.
